## Divide and Conquer

- involves dividing a data set into smaller chunk snad then rpeating a process with a subset of data
- this pattern and tremendously **decrease time complexity**

How work
- take data set (array, linked list, etc)
  - divide structure into pieces (rather than starting at one end and going to the other)
- popular example: binary search function
