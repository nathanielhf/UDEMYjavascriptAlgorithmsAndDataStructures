<h2>Introduction to Problem Solving</h2>

<h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>

* a **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task
  * mathematical steps, facebook algorithm to suggest ads, google search, etc.
  * also can be: calculate first 100 prime numbers

<h3>Why need to know this?</h3>

* almost **everything** in programming involves some kind of algorithm
* is **foundation** for being a successful problem solver and developer
* also interviews 

<h3>How do you improve?</h3>

* a degree of being predisposed to it
* but can still develop skill regardless of predisposition (just starting at different points)

1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems
2. **Master** common problem solving patterns

<h3>Problem Solving Strategies</h3>

* Understand the problem
* Explore concrete examples
* break it down
* solve/simplify
* look back and refactor

<h2>Step 1: Understand The Problem</h2>

Note: many adapted from *How To Solve It* by George Polya

<h3>Understand the Problem</h3>

* take step back and make sure understand task in front of you

Some helpful questions to ask of a problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's ok; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

<h2>Step 2. Concrete Examples</h2>

* Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
* Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
* Examples
  * User Stories! (e.g. given an input, what is our output?)
  * Unit Tests! (laying out how steps should work for a smaller feature)

<h3>Explore Examples</h3>

* Write down 2 or three simple examples
  * with an `input` and an `output`
* PRogress to More Complex Examples
* Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
  * an edge case
* Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs
  * more useful in real world

<h3>Concrete Problem: Write a function whcih takes in a string and returns counts of each chracter in the string<h3>
